# üìù Prompt Engineering

### üéØ What is Prompt Engineering and Why Does It Matter?

**Prompt engineering** isn't just asking questions ‚Äî it's **tactical guild deployment**. The DeFi Wizard houses multiple AI specialists, each with unique capabilities.

Your prompts determine which guild members activate, how deep they dig, and what intelligence they prioritize. Master this, and you're not just using a bot, but **commanding an elite intelligence network**.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Core Prompt Types

Your default "generic" starting point. Gives a **balanced overview** across fundamentals, TA, and sentiment in one go.

**`analyze <($ticker + network) or (contract_address)>`**

> Example:\
> `Analyze $DEGEN on Base, focus on TA (1h + 4h), include Twitter alpha data.`\
> `Analyze $TOSHI on Base`\
> `Analyze 0x123‚Ä¶`

### üß† Prompt Best Practices

| What To Do            | Why It Matters                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Be Specific           | Ticker + chain avoids ambiguity.                                           |
| Combine Contexts      | Merge TA + sentiment + volume = smarter signals.                           |
| Explore Social Layers | Ask about Twitter Communities or member behavior stats, last active posts. |
| Push the Bot          | It‚Äôs multi-agent ‚Äî stack insights and expect a judgment call.              |

`[ACTION] + [TARGET] + [CONTEXT/FOCUS] + [DESIRED TIMEFRAME] + [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]`
