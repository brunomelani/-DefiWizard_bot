# 📝 Prompt Engineering

## What is prompt engineering and why does it matter?

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective instructions (prompts) for generative AI models to produce desired outputs. It's a blend of art and science, requiring an understanding of how AI models interpret and respond to different types of prompts. By carefully designing prompts, you can guide the AI to generate accurate, relevant, and creative content.&#x20;

## 🧙‍♂️ Core Prompt Types

Here’s what you can ask — and full guide in how to get high-value responses and maximize your edge:

**`analyze <($ticker + network) or (contract_address)>`**

Your default "generic" starting point. Gives a **balanced overview** across fundamentals, TA, and sentiment in one go.

> **📌 TL;DR Prompt Formula**\
> `Analyze <token> on <chain> with focus on [TA / sentiment / narrative]. Add timeframe (optional) + (whatever else you might want).`
>
> Example:\
> `Analyze $DEGEN on Base, focus on TA (1h + 4h), include Twitter alpha data.`\
> `Analyze $TOSHI on Base`\
> `Analyze 0x123…`

***

## 🧩 Prompt Stacking

Combine strategies for deeper edge. You’re not just asking _what_, you’re setting **intent**.

> `Check 0x123… but focus only on strong TA setups in the last 24h.`\
> → Tactical targeting of recent entries.

> `Give me deep social sentiment on 0x123…`   \
> → Reputation sniffing + alpha filtration.

## 🧠 Prompt Best Practices

| What To Do            | Why It Matters                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Be Specific           | Ticker + chain avoids ambiguity.                                           |
| Combine Contexts      | Merge TA + sentiment + volume = smarter signals.                           |
| Explore Social Layers | Ask about Twitter Communities or member behavior stats, last active posts. |
| Push the Bot          | It’s multi-agent — stack insights and expect a judgment call.              |
