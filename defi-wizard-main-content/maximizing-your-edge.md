# 📝 Maximizing Your Edge

***

## 🧙‍♂️ Core Prompt Types

Here’s what you can ask — and how to get high-value responses:

**`analyze <($ticker + network) or (contract_address)>`**

Your default "generic" starting point. Gives a **balanced overview** across fundamentals, TA, and sentiment in one go.&#x20;

> **📌 TL;DR Prompt Formula**\
> `Analyze <token> on <chain> with focus on [TA / sentiment / narrative]. Add timeframe (optional) + (whatever else you might want).`
>
> Example:\
> `Analyze $DEGEN on Base, focus on TA (1h + 4h), include Twitter alpha data.`\
> `Analyze $TOSHI on Base`\
> `Analyze 0x123…`

***

## 🧩 Prompt Stacking

Combine strategies for deeper edge. You’re not just asking _what_, you’re setting **intent**.

> `Check 0x123… but focus only on strong TA setups in the last 24h.`\
> → Tactical targeting of recent entries.

> `Give me deep social sentiment on 0x123…`   \
> → Reputation sniffing + alpha filtration.

## 🧠 Prompt Best Practices

| What To Do            | Why It Matters                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Be Specific           | Ticker + chain avoids ambiguity.                                           |
| Combine Contexts      | Merge TA + sentiment + volume = smarter signals.                           |
| Explore Social Layers | Ask about Twitter Communities or member behavior stats, last active posts. |
| Push the Bot          | It’s multi-agent — stack insights and expect a judgment call.              |
