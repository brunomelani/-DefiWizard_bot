# 🔮 Maximizing Your Edge

To extract maximum value from [**@DefiWizard\_bot**](https://t.me/DefiWizard_Bot) :

#### 🧠 Understand the Stack

Behind every result is a **multi-agent AI system** doing layered analysis:

* **Frontliner Agent** — pulls token metadata, resolves contracts/networks, and builds context.
* **TA Agent** — performs multi-timeframe technical analysis using GeckoTerminal OHLCV data.
* **Sentiment Agent** — analyzes Twitter/X for community quality, influencer activity, and hype patterns.
* **Master Orchestrator** — weighs everything and returns an actionable “Master Assessment”.

Use that structure to your advantage. Tailor your query to engage the right parts of the system.

***

#### 🧙‍♂️ Core Prompt Types

Here’s what you can ask — and how to get high-value responses:

**`analyze <token or contract>`**

Your default starting point. Gives a **balanced overview** across fundamentals, TA, and sentiment.

> `Example:`\
> `analyze $TOSHI on Base`\
> `analyze 0x123… on Ethereum`

**Deep-Dive Variants:**

* **Technical Focus:**\
  `Analyze $GROK with focus on TA (4h and 1d)`
* **Social Focus:**\
  `Analyze $NORMIE with Twitter sentiment and influencer check`
* **Community Alpha:**\
  `Get last 10 tweets from @degen_eth, extract alpha and hashtags`

**Discovery Prompts:**

* **Trending Scan:**\
  `Scan trending on Solana`\
  `What’s pumping on Base right now?`
* **Narrative Digger:**\
  `Show tokens related to AI narrative with volume > $500k`

#### 🧩 Prompt Stacking

Combine strategies for deeper edge. You’re not just asking _what_, you’re setting **intent**.

> `Analyze $WIF on Solana with Twitter sentiment and TA 12h. Use Frontliner data for context.`\
> → This pulls from every system at once: metadata, charts, social energy, and merges it.

> `Check $PEPE but focus only on strong TA setups in the last 24h.`\
> → Tactical targeting of recent entries.

> `Find influencers tweeting about $BITCOIN BABY and check for giveaway spam or low-quality signals.`\
> → Reputation sniffing + alpha filtration.

***

#### 🫂 Team Synergy (Pro Team Tier)

If you're working in a group:

* Distribute daily credits among analysts.
* Share raw query results directly in Telegram or Notion.
* Assign roles (e.g., one runs sentiment, another validates TA).

Use the bot as a **central analyst**, not a sidekick.
