# 🔮 Maximizing Your Edge

***

## 🧙‍♂️ Core Prompt Types

Here’s what you can ask — and how to get high-value responses:

**`analyze <token or contract>`**

Your default starting point. Gives a **balanced overview** across fundamentals, TA, and sentiment.

> `Example:`\
> `analyze $TOSHI on Base`\
> `analyze 0x123… on Ethereum`

**Deep-Dive Variants:**

* **Technical Focus:**\
  `Analyze $GROK with focus on TA (4h and 1d)`
* **Social Focus:**\
  `Analyze $NORMIE with Twitter sentiment and influencer check`
* **Community Alpha:**\
  `Get last 10 tweets from @degen_eth, extract alpha and hashtags`

**Discovery Prompts:**

* **Narrative Digger:**\
  `Show tokens related to AI narrative with volume > $500k`

## 🧩 Prompt Stacking

Combine strategies for deeper edge. You’re not just asking _what_, you’re setting **intent**.

> `Analyze $WIF on Solana with Twitter sentiment and TA 12h. Use Frontliner data for context.`\
> → This pulls from every system at once: metadata, charts, social energy, and merges it.

> `Check $PEPE but focus only on strong TA setups in the last 24h.`\
> → Tactical targeting of recent entries.

> `Give me deep social sentiment on 0x123…`   \
> → Reputation sniffing + alpha filtration.
