# 🧙‍♂️ PROJECT FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

## 🧬️A Living Project

This system is designed to **evolve constantly**: new APIs, smarter sub-agents, deeper integrations, and stronger AI models will be added as they emerge ensuring that you're never left behind in a space where the meta changes by the hour.

As we grow, so does the vision:&#x20;

💠 Future upgrades may introduce **premium agent tiers**, **model scaling**, or even a **token-powered ecosystem** for active contributors and holders.&#x20;

💠 Today, most APIs used in the bot run on **free-tier limitations.** but scaling usage, partnerships, or community contributions may unlock **greater depth, speed, reliability and volume**.&#x20;

💠 New capabilities (like AI memory, token security audits, multi-chain TA models, and enhanced social analysis) are already in R\&D.

**🧪 Your Feedback is gold.**

We’re currently in an **open trial / beta phase**, which means:

* You get **full access** to cutting-edge tooling before the masses.
* Your **feedback, bug reports, and ideas directly shape** how this project grows.
* The wizard isn’t perfect (yet), but it’s getting smarter every day especially with your help.
