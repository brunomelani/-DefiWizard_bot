# 🧙‍♂️ Project Final Considerations

## 🧬️A Living Project

This system is designed to **evolve constantly**: new APIs, smarter sub-agents, deeper integrations, and stronger AI models will be added as they emerge ensuring that you're never left behind in a space where the meta changes by the hour.

As we grow, so does the vision:&#x20;

💠 Future upgrades may introduce **more powerful api tools**, **model scaling**, and potentially a **token gated ecosystem** that will benefit early users in future tokens airdrops.&#x20;

💠 Today, most APIs used in the bot run on **basic-tiers limitations.** but as user base grows we will continue to scaling usage, which will consequently unlocks even more powerful data endpoints for the planned future integrations.&#x20;

💠 New capabilities (like Graph memory, token security audits, multi-chain longer historic data access, and enhanced social analysis) are already in R\&D. Partnerships, or community contributions may unlock **greater depth, speed, reliability and volume**.&#x20;

***

**🧪 Your Feedback is gold.**

We’re currently in an **open trial / beta phase**, which means:

* You get **full access** to cutting-edge tooling before the masses.
* Your **feedback, bug reports, and ideas directly shape** how this project grows.
* The wizard isn’t perfect (yet), but it’s getting smarter every day especially with your help.
