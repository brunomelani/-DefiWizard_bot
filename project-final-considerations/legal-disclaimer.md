However, all insights and signals provided are **for informational and educational purposes only**. They are not intended as personalized investment recommendations or guarantees of performance.

Cryptocurrency and DeFi markets are inherently volatile, rapidly evolving, and involve significant risk. **You are solely responsible for your investment decisions**. Always conduct your own due diligence and consult a licensed financial advisor before making any investment.
