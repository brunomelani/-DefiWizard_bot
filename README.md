Real-Time Clarity: Delivers HTML-formatted Telegram responses with actionable insights.
Ever-Evolving: Continuously upgraded with new tools, APIs, and agents to maximize value.

Core Capabilities
@DefiWizard_bot leverages a robust, multi-agent system to provide:

Token Metadata Extraction:

The Frontliner fetches critical token data (market cap, volume, creation time, social links, chain) from GeckoTerminal and DexScreener.
Resolves token identities by name, ticker, or contract address across 100+ networks.


Market Intelligence:

Tracks CEX and DEX market dynamics via CoinGecko MCP and GeckoTerminal.
Monitors volume, liquidity, and price trends for real-time opportunities.


Multi-Timeframe Technical Analysis:

Analyzes price action using Syve.ai (Ethereum/Base) and GeckoTerminal OHLCV data.
Applies indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and patterns (Elliott Waves, Fibonacci) across 15m, 1h, 4h, and 1d timeframes.


Social Sentiment Tracking:

Dives into Twitter (X) activity to gauge community hype, influencer signals, and potential risks.
Detects bot-like behavior and verifies project legitimacy.


Orchestrated Insights:

Synthesizes multi-agent outputs into concise, actionable recommendations.
Delivers HTML-formatted Telegram responses with clear market positioning and risk levels.



Architecture: A Masterful Swarm
@DefiWizard_bot’s power lies in its meticulously designed, modular architecture built on n8n. The Frontliner sets the foundation, and the orchestrator directs a swarm of specialized agents for unparalleled efficiency.
1. The Frontliner

Purpose: Collects foundational token metadata to streamline analysis.
Function:

Resolves token identities (name, ticker, or contract address) and validates network compatibility (e.g., Ethereum’s 42-char 0x, Solana’s Base58, Sui’s 66-char 0x).
Fetches market cap, 24h volume, creation time, social links, and chain data using GeckoTerminal and DexScreener APIs.
Outputs enriched JSON (e.g., token_id, chain, mc, volume, socials) for the orchestrator.


Impact: Ensures sub-agents start with high-quality, structured data, boosting efficiency and accuracy.

2. @DefiWizard_bot (Master Orchestrator)

Purpose: Coordinates the agent swarm to deliver comprehensive insights.
Function:

Delegates tasks to sub-agents based on query intent and The Frontliner’s metadata.
Synthesizes results into actionable recommendations.
Formats Telegram responses in HTML for clarity and professionalism.


Key Features:

Optimizes task allocation to minimize API calls and respect rate limits.
Seamlessly integrates market, technical, and social data.



3. Specialized Sub-Agents

CoinGecko MCP Subagent:

Retrieves CEX market data (prices, volume, trends).
Manages 30/min rate limits for efficiency.


GeckoTerminal DEX Subagent:

Extracts DEX token/pool data across 200+ networks and 1,600+ DEXs.
Batches up to 30 tokens per call for scalability.


TA Agent Master:

Conducts multi-timeframe technical analysis using Syve.ai (Ethereum/Base) and GeckoTerminal OHLCV.
Delegates timeframes to sub-agents for parallel processing.


Twitter X Agent:

Analyzes Twitter activity for sentiment, influencer patterns, and community quality.
Flags risks like giveaway spam or bot accounts.


Future Sub-Agents (In Development):

Token Security Specialist: Contract audits via GoPlus API.
Social Sentiment Analyst: Multi-platform narrative analysis.



4. Workflow Precision

Metadata Enrichment: The Frontliner’s initial data ensures sub-agents focus on specialized tasks, reducing redundancy.
Memory Management: Uses memoryBufferWindow nodes to maintain user session context.
Error Handling: Implements retries and fallbacks for robust API interactions.
Rate Limit Optimization: Coordinates requests to respect API limits (e.g., 30/min for GeckoTerminal, CoinGecko).

Example Workflow

User sends: “Analyze $WIF on Solana” to @DefiWizard_bot.
The Frontliner validates the token, confirms Solana network, and fetches metadata (market cap: $20M, volume: $5M, creation: 2024-01-15, socials).
@DefiWizard_bot delegates:

CoinGecko MCP: CEX price and volume trends.
GeckoTerminal: DEX pool data and liquidity.
TA Agent: Price action on 1h and 4h timeframes.
Twitter X Agent: Sentiment and community signals.
