It delivers real-time, actionable insights on tokens, market trends, technical analysis, and social sentiment, empowering traders, degens, and teams to navigate the fast-paced world of decentralized finance with confidence.

Architecture Overview

@DefiWizard_bot features a sophisticated, multi-agent architecture optimized for efficiency and scalability:





Frontliner Agent: Collects token metadata (market cap, volume, creation time, social links, chain) from GeckoTerminal and DexScreener, enriching queries for seamless processing.



Master Orchestrator: The core of the bot, coordinating a swarm of specialized sub-agents, delegating tasks, and synthesizing insights into HTML-formatted Telegram responses.



Sub-Agents: A powerful network of specialists:





CoinGecko MCP: Provides centralized exchange (CEX) data.



GeckoTerminal DEX: Delivers decentralized exchange (DEX) data.



TA Agent Master: Conducts technical analysis across multiple timeframes.



Twitter X Agent: Analyzes social sentiment from Twitter.



Planned Additions: Token Security Specialist and Social Sentiment Analyst.

This system supports comprehensive token analysis across over 100 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Sui, and ApeChain.
