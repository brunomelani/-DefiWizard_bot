# ❓ Why use Defi-Wizard?

## What Makes the Wizard Worthy?

Trying to keep up with **thousands of daily new tokens**, **hundreds of blockchains**, and **an endless flood of narratives** every day is **pure mental warfare.**

**The Reality Check:**

* Doing proper due diligence on even **5 tokens daily** is already exhausting
* **Multi-timeframe technical analysis** per token take time, and emotions get on the way.
* **Social sentiment analysis** requires monitoring dozens of profiles and community channels
* **Security audits** and contract analysis demand specialized expertise most traders lack
* **Liquidity depth analysis**  is time-consuming and complex

The deeper you dig, the more time it consumes, and eventually you hit that dreaded **analysis paralysis** wall. This overwhelming data flood leads even experienced traders to **cut corners** and rush into plays, consequently making poor investment choices or missing solid opportunities due to lack of proper context.
